<h1> UIUC Crime Map </h1>
The goal of our project is to create a simple web application that displays crimes recorded on the <a href="https://police.illinois.edu/crime-reporting/daily-crime-log/">UIUC Daily Crime Log</a>. Our goal is to provide members of the UIUC community with an easy way to identify areas where crimes are occuring so they can avoid them.
